#Raft - Open-Source PaaS
The idea behind raft and mangoraft.com is to give the node community a fully-featured Platform as a Service (PaaS). 
Raft gives you a provision of CPU, memory, disk space and bandwidth. From this the sky's the limit in what can be build. Sites and services ranging from the weekend projects to large scale production sites are able to take advantage of raft. Full instances of a UNIX system is available from with in the running allocation. Each application is run in its own chroot jail. Keeping all other applications sharing the system safe.
##Convenient 
Deploy your application in under 30 seconds. Fast deploys mean even more time to build and debug your applications.
##Scalable 
Run more than one instance of your application. A global footprint is no problem, run your application independent to any LaaS providers or even run it on your own hardware.
##Distributed
 To take advantage of today's cloud provider. raft has been built to run on more then one server that is running in more than one data center. Raft uses a distributed event system allowing you to run more than one instance of each service. So if you wanted to host tens of thousands of your favorite express app, raft can do it. 
##Open-source
All the code is open source. If you would like to run your own copy of raft you can. Even better then the git repo is that you can install it all with one command. "npm install raft-hooks -g" this will install a program called hooks. Take a look at "hooks -h" for help on how to use the client.
## Status
Lots of work is been done on Raft. If you would like to know more please drop me a line!
